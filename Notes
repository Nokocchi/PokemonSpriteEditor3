    - Palette grid, make edges blurry or add arrows or something to show scrollablenessability
- Cool Header:
    - Implement sprite animation

Code quality:
- Update color pickers:
    - MultiColorPicker is really badly coded because I just wanted to be done with it :(
    - Use same Color Picker component for both single and multicolor change. 
- Palette Grid
    - Should it be changed in a different way than a dropdown?
