- Figure out generics for the colorpickers. It seems silly that there is so much duplicate code, but on the other hand, it is limited to only 3 sliders and 3 formats, so... maybe its okay?
- RGB<->HSL Conversion function seems to be buggy and produce colors slightly off
- Resetting through multicolor does not work for colorpickers in HSL mode? Abra, red-blue, the dark yellow color didn't seem to get reset properly
- Update color picker:
    - Multi color picker should look the same as a normal color picker
    - Mobile version, less buttons and textfields
    - Full width


Reset full pokemon doesn't work if it has been changed with multicolor
Keep palette grid size when resetting
