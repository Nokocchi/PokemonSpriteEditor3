Bugs:
- Fix the search box for selecting Pokemons. It looks different from the normal dropdown and it is rendered under the canvas..

Features:
- Canvas
    - When selecting / Multiselecting, the selected colors should be highlighted on the original sprite
- Palette Grid
    - Palette grid, make edges blurry or add arrows or something to show scrollablenessability
- Cool Header:
    - Implement sprite animation

Code quality:
- Update color pickers:
    - MultiColorPicker is really badly coded because I just wanted to be done with it :(
    - Use same Color Picker component for both single and multicolor change. 
- Palette Grid
    - Should it be changed in a different way than a dropdown? 
- Enforce strict TS typing
- Clean up types.ts which is currently a mess
