Bugs:
- RGB<->HSL Conversion function seems to be buggy and produce colors slightly off
- Fix the search box for selecting Pokemons. It looks different from the normal dropdown and it is rendered under the canvas..

Features:
- Palette Grid
    - Palette grid, make edges blurry or add arrows or something to show scrollablenessability

Code quality:
- Update color picker:
    - Use same Color Picker component for both single and multicolor change. 
    - Check all the store/mount logic in the colorpicker. Is it still needed now that they are created on demand? 
- Palette Grid
    - Should it be changed in a different way than a dropdown? 
- Enforce strict TS typing
- Clean up types.ts which is currently a mess
